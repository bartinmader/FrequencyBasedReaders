# This step is mainly manual. Each URI must be provided with a tag
# specifying whether a specific story is to be included into the
# final reader or not. The format is as follows:

# URI # ..... # YES
#     - where "....." is the URI
#     - YES is to include
#     - NO is to exclude
#     - REV is to consider reviewing (will not be included by the script)

# the script will collect the selected URIs into a separate file,
# which will be used to generate the reader
